<h1>You Won't Believe How Easy It Is to Make This Beet Hummus Recipe</h1>
<iframe width="780" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UBq35JWbBG0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen style=""></iframe>
<p>Do you ever feel like your cooking skills can’t keep up with your palate? Maybe your taste buds are craving dishes like caramelized zucchini flatbread and chocolate mascarpone mousse. But all you can handle is spaghetti with red sauce and chocolate chip cookies. Well, YouTube star Natasha Feldman, host of Nosh with Tash, has your back.</p>

<p><q>My show is all about finding ways to make really delicious food that's attainable for busy people who just don't have the time to prepare or the interest in super complicated dishes,</q> Feldman told Health. She also wants her followers to know that not everything you whip up in the kitchen has to be Instagram-ready. Feldman encourages newbie cooks to explore and be creative, without worrying about what the end product looks like. <q>I think most of the delicious food I've had in my life has been ugly. I'm okay with less than perfect-looking food. I think delicious is a much better standard.</q></p>

<p>Below, Feldman shares her recipe for <a href="https://www.noshwithtash.com/blog/hummus">Millennial Beet Hummus</a>, which happens to be both tasty and gorgeous (it's bright pink!). All you need to do is throw nine ingredients in a food processor. <q>Once I started making this dish, I began noticing all the places hummus could and should be: on a sandwich, served with sliced veggies, thrown on top of a salad, served beneath roasted white fish, eaten on a cracker, and more," says Feldman. "Hummus makes almost anything more delicious, especially when it's pink, and will make your dish look 1,000% fancier.</q></p>

<h3>RECEIPE</h3>
<p>Once I started making this dish I started noticing all the places that hummus could and should be... on a sandwich, served with sliced veggies, thrown on top of a salad, served beneath roasted white fish,  eaten on a cracker.</p>

<p>Hummus makes almost anything more delicious, especially when it's pink and will make any dish look 1000% more fancy.</p>

<p>My only recommendation here is that you use GOOD tahini. A mediocre - bad tahini will really ruin your hummus. My preferred variety is SOOM, but JOYVA is good too!</p>
